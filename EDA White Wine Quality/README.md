# Remarks

In this project the data the project is build on is not included in the repository. To download the data to the repository run the download the data section once. After that the lines which call the download function can be comment out to prevent the code from downloading the data every time you run the code.

The loading of the needed libaries is done automatically with the help of the paketmanger pacman.
