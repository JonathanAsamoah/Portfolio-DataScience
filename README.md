# Portfolio

This repository contains some of my projects in the area of Data Science. The projects are mostly related to the common tasks in the domain of Data Science data wrangling, visualization, statistics and machine learning.
The [Remarks](#Remarks) section of this document contians some general informations to run the projects.
The [List of Projects](#List-of-Projects) section lists all projects in this repository and is followed by the [Projects Short Description](#Projects-Short-Description) section that contains a short explanition of the projects, a link to the project, highlights the technologies and the data used.

# Remarks

All Python projects inside this repository use the Python Version 3.

For most projects in this repository Jupyter Notebook is used. If you run in some problems running it please consider the [documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) on the Jupyter Notebook site.

Most of the projects inside the repository doesn't contain the data the project is build on. Therefore, to run the code in the projects on your own you have to download the data. If this is nessary a explanition to do this is included in the projects README.md file.

# Project Short Descriptions

## [Machine Learning Enron Email Dataset PoI Identifier](https://github.com/JonathanAsamoah/Portfolio/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20Enron%20Email%20Dataset%20PoI%20Identifier)
In this project data from the Enron email dataset and public Enron financial data is used to create an classifier that allows to identify employes of Enron who may have committed fraud. The results found here can be used as a starting point for the identification of possible fraud in similar cases and in this way help to prevent and detect fraud.
