# Remarks

In the most of the shared projects inside the repository the data the projects are build on is not included in the repository.
If the data is not shared with the project. You can download it to your local repository by once uncomment the line to fetch the data from the original source. Once this is done the data will be stored inside the data folder in your local repository.

All the python projects contain a requirments.txt file. Which you can use to load the required libraries for the project using ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.
