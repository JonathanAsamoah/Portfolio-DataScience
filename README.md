# Portfolio

This repository contains some of my projects in the area of Data Science. The projects are mostly related to the common tasks in the domain of Data Science data wrangling, visuliatzion, statistics and machine learning.
The Remark section of this document contians some general informations to execute the project.
The Projects section gives an ... of all ... in this repository, a short explanition of the projects and a link to the project.

# Remarks

The most projects inside the repository don't contain the data the projects are build on.  
Therefor, to run the code in the projects on your own you have to download the data. If this is nessary a explanition to do this is included in the projects readme file.
