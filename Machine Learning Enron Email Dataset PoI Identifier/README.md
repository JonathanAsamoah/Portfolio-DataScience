# Machine Learning Enron Email Dataset PoI Identifier

In this project data from the Enron email dataset and public Enron financial data is used to create an classifier that allows to identify employes of Enron who may have committed fraud. The results found here can be used as a starting point for the identification of possible fraud in similar cases and in this way help to prevent and detect fraud.

The used data for analysis was provied by [Udacity](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiAgMfxyYDTAhVFbxQKHRqrBjYQFggfMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fde.udacity.com%2F&usg=AFQjCNGjOkTqlePG4GsyvLxJqSfgnQk_wQ) and is a already preprocessed version oaf a subset of the Enron email dataset. It is already provided in the repository.
