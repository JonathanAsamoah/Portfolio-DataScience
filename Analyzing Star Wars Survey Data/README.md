# Analyzing Star Wars Survey

The project analyzes the question Does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch? That the team at FiveThirtyEight was interested in while waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

The dataset used in this project is provided by [FiveThirtyEight](https://www.fivethirtyeight.com/). The dataset was created with SurveyMonkey and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data).  

# Languages/Technologies

* Python 
  * pandas
  * matplotlib

# Remarks

In this project not all the data the project is build on is included in the repository. To download the missing data to the repository run the download the data section once. After that the lines which call the download function can be comment out to prevent the code from downloading the data every time you run the code.

The python project contains a requirments.txt file. Which you can use to load the required libraries for the project using ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.
