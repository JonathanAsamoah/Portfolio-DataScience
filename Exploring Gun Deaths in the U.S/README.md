The dataset used in this project is provided by [FiveThirtyEight](https://www.fivethirtyeight.com/). The documentation and the dataset can be accessed [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data).  
Also the Census data is used to evalute gun deaths in relation to race categories.

# Languages/Technologies

# Remarks

In this project the data the project is build on is not included in the repository. To download the data to the repository run the *Download the data* section once. After that the lines which call the download function can be comment out to prevent the code from downloading the data every time you run the code.

The python project contains a requirements.txt file. Which you can use to load the required libraries for the project using ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.
