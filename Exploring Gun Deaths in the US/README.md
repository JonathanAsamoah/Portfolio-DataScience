# Exploring Gun Deaths in the US

In this project the gun deaths in the US for the years 2012 to 2014 are analyzed.

The dataset used in this project is provided by [FiveThirtyEight](https://www.fivethirtyeight.com/). The documentation and the dataset can be accessed [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data).  
Also the Census data is used to evalute gun deaths in relation to race categories.

# Languages/Technologies

* Python 
  * pandas

# Remarks

In this project not all the data the project is build on is included in the repository. To download the missing data to the repository run the download the data section once. After that the lines which call the download function can be comment out to prevent the code from downloading the data every time you run the code.

The python project contains a requirments.txt file. Which you can use to load the required libraries for the project using ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.
